Project
Ravenous, Yelp-like clone.

Concepts Covered
* utilized the React library
* importing and exporting components
* the Yelp API 
* passing information using props, state 

Ideas for Other Features
* Make addresses clickable and have them open the address in Google Maps in a new tab
* Make images clickable and have them open the business' website in a new tab
* Clicking on a different sorting option automatically requeries the Yelp API, rather than having to manually click "Let's Go" again
* Implement your own type of sort (for example, by entering a distance or radius from a central location)
* Allow you to search by pressing "Enter" (or "Return") on your keyboard, as opposed to manually clicking
* Add autocompletion of addresses to the "Location" input
